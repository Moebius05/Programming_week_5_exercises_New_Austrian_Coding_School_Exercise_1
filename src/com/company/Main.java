/*Exercise 1
 Derek goes to a modern art museum and gets fascinated by the shapes and colors of the paintings.
  Follow the instructions below:
   Create the Shape interface.
    It has the getName method that returns a String.
     Create the Circle class that implements the Shape interface.
      Implement the getName method with the help of Intellij.
       Return the word circle in that method.
        Create the CircleApplication class and write the following instructions in its main method:
         Create a Circle and display its name.
          In a new line, assign the circle variable to a Shape variable called shape.
           Just use the = symbol.
            Display the shape’s name.
           Create another Circle, but this time assign it directly to a Shape with the name anotherShape.
            Display anotherShape’s name.
             Create the CircleTest class that tests that the Circle is working correctly as both Circle and Shape.
              Class: circle
               Shape: circle
                Another shape: circle

package com.company;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape.
	// write your code here
    }
}
